                Push the setting change to `$config`:

                What this does, is it starts at the deepest nesting level of the
                setting in the configuration array, finds the parent array of
                the setting, and changes the setting in that array. Example for
                "security/approval/require": The `$value` is, say, `true`. The
                deepest nested item in the array for that setting is "require",
                as it is the last item in the path. The parent of "require" is
                "security/approval".

                "security/approval" is retrieved:

                    $parent = array(
                        "require" => false,
                        "by-qr" => true
                    );

                ..and the value of "require" (the next item in the setting's
                path after "security/approval") is set to `$value`. Note how the
                value of "require" has changed:

                    $parent = array(
                        "require" => true,
                        "by-qr" => true
                    );

                `$value` is now set to `$parent`, so `$value` becomes the above
                array. The loop now iterates to set "security/approval" in the
                array. The parent of "security/approval" (i.e. "security") is
                retrieved:

                    $parent = array(
                        "approval" => array(
                            "require" => false,
                            "by-qr" => true
                        ),
                        "validate-ua" => "lenient",
                        "validate-lang" => true
                    );

                ..and the value of "approval" (the next item in the setting's
                path after "security") is set to `$value`. Since `$value` is the
                "approval" array with the "require" setting patched to `true`,
                the entire "approval" array in `$parent` is overwritten:

                    $parent = array(
                        "approval" => array(
                            "require" => true,
                            "by-qr" => true
                        ),
                        "validate-ua" => "lenient",
                        "validate-lang" => true
                    );

                Again, note that the "approval/require" value has changed to
                reflect the update. `$value` is once again set to the value of
                `$parent` so that `$value` now holds the entire updated
                "security" array. Next, the loop iterates to set "security"
                itself. The parent of "security" (i.e. the root array) is
                retrieved:

                    $parent = array(
                        "security" => array(
                            "approval" => array(
                                "require" => false,
                                "by-qr" => true
                            ),
                            "validate-ua" => "lenient",
                            "validate-lang" => true
                        ),
                        "auth" => array(
                            ...
                        ),
                        ...
                    );

                As before, the "security" key is replaced with the updated
                "security" element stored in `$value`:

                    $parent = array(
                        "security" => array(
                            "approval" => array(
                                "require" => true,
                                "by-qr" => true
                            ),
                            "validate-ua" => "lenient",
                            "validate-lang" => true
                        ),
                        "auth" => array(
                            ...
                        ),
                        ...
                    );

                ..and again note that the value of "security/approval/require"
                has been correctly updated to `true` in this array. `$value` is
                once again updated to the value of `$parent`.

                At this point, we have iterated over all the segments of the
                settings path ("require", "approval" and "security"), so the
                loop ends. Since we retrieved the root array into `$parent`,
                `$value` now holds the patched root configuration array. We can
                overwrite the old configuration in `self::$config` with this
                updated array, and the configuration array used by this script
                will thus be the updated version where the value of
                "security/approval/require" is updated.
