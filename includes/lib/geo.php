        "Directions" button on the POI details overlay on the map, when posting
        webhook messages with navigation URLs, and when clicking on the link to
        a POI's location in the list of POIs on the administration pages.

            The algorithm we're using is adapted from W. Randolph Franklin's
            Point Inclusion in Polygon Test code described here:
            https://wrf.ecse.rpi.edu//Research/Short_Notes/pnpoly.html

            The algorithm works by drawing a vertical ray straight out from the
            given latitude and longitude point that should be tested. If the
            point is inside the polygon, when starting at the point and moving
            along the vertical ray towards Y=Infinity, one has to cross the
            boundary of the polygon at some point, according to the Jordan curve
            theorem.

            The vertical ray may cross the boundary several times; into and out
            of the polygon. Hence, we count the number of boundary crossings. If
            the ray crosses an even number of times, then the starting point
            lies outside of the polygon. If we cross the ray an odd number of
            times, the starting point lies inside the polygon. The following
            illustrates this:

                | Starting point = S               |

            Since the state of whether the point is inside or outside the
            polygon changes with each boundary crossing, we'll declare a boolean
            variable that will be flipped at every border crossing. It starts at
            `false` to indicate the point being outside the polygon at zero
            boundary crossings. At one crossing, this will flip to `true`, and
            at two crossings (it leaves the polygon) it's reset to `false`, then
            `true` for three crossings, etc.

            To count boundary crossings, we'll have to check whether the ray
            drawn vertically from the starting point crosses every segment of
            the boundary. To do this, we loop over two variables.

            The boundary of the polygon is a continuous loop. This means that
            every point defining the boundary has neighboring points in two
            directions. Since `$geofence` is an array containing all the points,
            we can loop over that array and refer to each point as an index,
            where the preceding and succeeding indices for any particular point
            represent the neighboring points for that point:

                0---------------1

                |         \
                6----------5

            We need to check whether the ray crosses each of the segments in
            that polygon, where each segment connects two points A and B. Hence
            we need to check:

                +--------+
                | A -> B |
                +--------+
                | 6 -> 0 |
                | 0 -> 1 |
                | 1 -> 2 |
                | 2 -> 3 |
                | 3 -> 4 |
                | 4 -> 5 |
                | 5 -> 6 |
                +--------+

            As can be seen from the table, A is always the point index
            immediately preceding the B index, such that for each next iteration
            of the loop over the segments, the new A index will become what was
            the B index in the previous iteration. We can therefore write a loop
            with two variables, `$a` and `$b`, where `$b` starts at index 0 and
            `$a` starts at the point immediately preceding `$a`, i.e. index 6,
            the last index of the array. The loop runs until all indices have
            been iterated over, and for each iteration, `$a` is set to the value
            of `$b`, and `$b` is then incremented by 1.

                and B to separate variables.

                Since we're only counting boundary crossings, we can safely
                ignore any segments which we do not cross. This is done by
                checking whether both `$aLon` and `$bLon` are both on the same
                side of `$lon`. If they are not on the same side, the ray
                crosses the boundary.

                There may be cases where the infinite ray crosses directly
                through a point/vertex. To handle this, we use inequalities to
                shift the ray from the point an infinitesimal distance to the
                right of the vertex, so that the infinite ray either clearly
                intersects or does not intersect the segment. E.g. consider a
                segment from lon=0 to lon=10, with the infinite ray at lon=10:

                    EXAMPLE 1: Segment on the left side of the ray

                    $lon = 10;
                    $aLon = 0
                    $bLon = 10;
                    $aLon > $lon == false;
                    $bLon > $lon == false;

                The greater-than inequality in practice moves the ray
                infinitesimally to the right, putting both A and B to the left
                of the ray, meaning the ray is just out of range of crossing the
                segment. Now consider a segment from lon=10 to lon=20 for the
                same ray:

                    EXAMPLE 2: Segment on the right side of the ray

                    $lon = 10;
                    $aLon = 10;
                    $bLon = 20;
                    $aLon > $lon == false;
                    $bLon > $lon == true;

                The inequality puts point A to the left and point B to the right
                of the infinite ray, creating an intersection. This allows us to
                handle all cases of vertex pass-through:

                    EXAMPLE 1:                              \  v

                /*
                    At this point, we have successfully identified that there
                    has been a change of state for the point's presence in the
                    polygon. The ray moved either into or out of the polygon.
                    Now we have to ensure that boundary crossings are only
                    counted on one side of the point (i.e. a ray starting at
                    the point and moving downwards only, rather than a line
                    going both directions). If the ray was in fact a line going
                    both directions, boundary crossings would in fact be counted
                    as if the line passed through the whole polygon from the
                    outside, rather than starting as a ray on the inside. The
                    result would be that the point would wrongly be reported as
                    outside the polygon in all possible cases.

                    The simple way to check this is to check whether the
                    starting point is actually below the current segment. We
                    need to find the intersection latitude between the current
                    segment and the vertical ray from the starting point. Given
                    the longitudes of the point and the endpoints of the two
                    segments, we can calculate a fraction F between the
                    horizontal displacements `$lon` -> `$bLon` and
                    `$aLon` -> `$bLon`:

                            1-F          F

                    F is the fraction of how far away from B the intersection of
                    the vertical ray from S with the segment AB is, relative to
                    the distance between A and B, on the horizontal axis. Since
                    AB is linear, the same is also true for the vertical axis.
                    Hence, F multiplied with the vertical displacement between B
                    and A gives the vertical displacement of the intersection
                    point of the ray from S with segment AB relative to B. If we
                    add the vertical displacement between B and 0 (i.e. the
                    latitude of B) to this displacement, we get the displacement
                    of the intersection point relative to 0, i.e. the latitude
                    of the displacement point.

                    We can then check if this latitude is below the latitude of
                    the point we are verifying against the polygon (`$lat`). If
                    it is, then the ray would intersect it on the way downwards
                    towards negative infinity.
