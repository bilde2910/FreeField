API Reference
=============

FreeField has a RESTful API for third-party developers to interface with their
instances. This document serves as the reference for this API.

Authentication
--------------

All requests to the API must be authenticated using an access token. To obtain
an access token, go to the "API access" section of the administration pages and
click on :guilabel:`Add new client`.

1. Define a name for your client. This name will be publicly visible when the
   client adds, modifies and deletes Pok√©stops and other resources using the
   API. The client name is displayed in lieu of a user account's nickname where
   such a nickname would otherwise be shown.

2. Optionally select a color for your client to accompany its name when
   displayed.

3. Click in the "Permissions" column for your client to define access controls
   for your client.

   -  Check all permissions in the permissions list that your client needs to
      operate.

   -  Set a reasonable permission level for the client's capability of
      administering FreeField. For example, if your client has permission to
      manage and delete user accounts in your FreeField instance, the client can
      do so only for users up to and including the given permission level. The
      permission level is exclusively used for this purpose - permissions set on
      the "Permissions" section of the administration interface are overridden
      by the permissions specified for your client under "API settings." The
      permission level setting is currently not in use, but will be used in a
      future version of FreeField.

   Click on :guilabel:`Save settings` when you are done.

4. Click :guilabel:`Save settings` when you are done to generate an access
   token.

5. In the "Access token" column, click on :guilabel:`Click to view` to view and
   copy the access token for your client.

**To authenticate your client against the API, set the** ``X-Access-Token``
**header of every request to the access token from step 5 above.**
