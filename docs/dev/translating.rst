Translating FreeField
=====================

FreeField relies on crowd-sourced translation. If you speak another language
than English natively, you are very welcome to contribute your language to the
project.

Getting started
---------------

FreeField uses the Crowdin localization platform. To get started on Crowdin,
`sign up for an account <https://crowdin.com/join>`_ if you don't already have
one, then go to the FreeField project using this URL:

`https://crowdin.com/project/freefield
<https://crowdin.com/project/freefield>`_

Click on your language to start translating. If your language isn't listed,
please `create an issue on the issue tracker on GitHub
<https://github.com/bilde2910/FreeField/issues/new>`_ stating which language
(and if applicable, which regional dialect/variant) you wish to localize the
project in, and the language/locale will be created for you.

Files to translate
------------------

The file view on Crowdin lists several files to translate, labeled by the types
of strings that the file contains. Some files are prioritized; these are labeled
with an up arrow (ðŸ ©) on the right hand side and should be localized first. Low
priority files, labeled with a down arrow (ðŸ «), should be localized last.

.. note:: You do not have to translate everything! Translate as many strings as
          you want, but please start translating the high priority files first.

Questions
---------

If you have any questions about translating FreeField, do not hesistate to raise
an issue on the `issue tracker on GitHub
<https://github.com/bilde2910/FreeField/issues>`_ with your question. We value
feedback on anything that might be unclear, and your input could help us write
better documentation for others who many have the same question as you.
