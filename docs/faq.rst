Why are some markers hidden from the map?
-----------------------------------------

Starting from version 1.1, FreeField will start hiding markers when there are
more than 100 markers in the visible area of the map in order to improve the
map's performance. If you want to change this behavior, please do the following:

1. Open the settings menu from the sidebar.
2. Scroll down to the "Performance" section.
3. Next to "Maximum visible markers," select how many markers you want to be
   visible on the map at the same time.
4. Click on :guilabel:`Save settings`.

.. note:: Increasing the number of markers on the map will cause the map to be
          sluggish when many of them are visible on the map.
